# For calculating the paint needed, the program should calculate the amount of paint needed to paint the walls of a room of the given length and width. You may use the following assumptions:

# Paint covers 315 square feet per gallon
# Each door in the room is 25 square feet and each window is 10 square feet.
# Rooms may contain four walls. Each wall can be considered a rectangle. The total area needed to paint the walls would area of the rectangle.
# 2 walls in the room will be a product of width and height, and the other 2 walls would be a product of the length and height of the room.
# Subtract door surface area and window area from the total area of the wall to be painted
# To calculate the volume of paint needed, you will have to divide the total area to be painted by the area that can be covered for a gallon.
